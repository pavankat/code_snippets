dealing with remote branches

	pull all remote branches for a repo

		for remote in `git branch -r`; do git branch --track ${remote#origin/} $remote; done

	To list remote branches:

		git branch -r

	You can check them out as local branches with:

		git checkout -b LocalName origin/remotebranchname

managing multiple github accounts with ssh

	ssh-add -l 

	will list all the SSH keys attached to the ssh-agent. Remove all of them and add the one key you are about to use.

	----------

	to switch to your work identity 
	
		//removes all ssh entries from the ssh-agent
			ssh-add -D 

		// Adds the relevant ssh key
			ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work_user1 

	of course, id_rsa_work_user1 needs to exist first and must be specified in the config file in ~/.ssh

	----------

	to switch to your personal identity 

		//removes all ssh entries from the ssh-agent
			ssh-add -D 

		// Adds the relevant ssh key
			ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

	of course, id_rsa needs to exist first and must be specified in the config file in ~/.ssh

	when in a repo ensure the username and email is correct by checking

		To list the config name and email in the local Git directory, do 

			git config user.name 
		
		and 

			git config user.email

		If it's not found, update accordingly.

		// Updates git config user name
			git config user.name "Pavan Katepalli"   
		
		// Updates git config email
			git config user.email "pavankat@gmail.com"

		when cloning

			The work repository will require a change to be made with this command:

			git clone git@github.com-work_user1:work_user1/repo_name.git

			work_user1 is what was set up in the config file of ~/.ssh

deleting commits

	https://www.clock.co.uk/insight/deleting-a-git-commit

	if you want to go back in time to a particular commit

	then you can do this:

		Reset master to last usable commit.
		$ git reset --hard b3d92c5 
		
		Push master to the remote repo.
		git push --hard origin master
